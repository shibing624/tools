Is Disability Insurance Required By Law?	Not generally. There are five states that require most all employers carry short term disability insurance on their employees. These states are: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Besides this mandatory short term disability law, there is no other legislative imperative for someone to purchase or be covered by disability insurance.
Can Creditors Take Life Insurance After Death?	If the person who passed away was the one with the debt, creditors generally cannot take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was a person. The money then belongs to that beneficiary, and as long as creditors do not have a claim against the beneficiary, they cannot take life insurance proceeds from them.
Does Travelers Insurance Have Renters Insurance?	One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes, you can purchase Renters insurance through Travelers. I would look for a local agent who can assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested. I am sure the local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other carries as well.
Can I Drive A New Car Home Without Insurance?	Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car. It is never a good idea to drive a car without insurance. If you traded a car in, then the coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily, but you need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed. Most dealerships have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well.
