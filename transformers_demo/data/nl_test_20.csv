2,'Mtendere Village was inspired by the vision of Chief Napoleon Dzombe  which he shared with John Blanchard" during his first visit to Malawi. Chief Napoleon conveyed the desperate need for a program to intervene and care" for the orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Malawi  and John committed to help.'
4,'Mtendere Village is home to 134 children  living in 16 homes with a housemother and several brothers and" sisters. This family environment is one that many of the children have never previously experienced. 100X has" also built a library and multipurpose building on the property—giving the children a place to gather together " learn and build community.'
5,'The children attend a local primary school and receive afterschool tutoring at home in the afternoon. All of" the school fees  uniforms  and supplies are paid for through our sponsorship program. Once children progress to" secondary school (9th grade)  they attend boarding school and return home during school breaks. Through" education  these children will have the resources necessary to provide a better future for themselves and for" their families—one where they are never faced with the decision of whether or not to abandon their own children.'
6,'Maternal Health. Right now  1 in 18 women in Malawi will die during their lifetime due to complications and" the lack of medical care during pregnancy and delivery. For every 100 000 births that occur in Malawi this year " more than 800 mothers will die during delivery or shortly after because of complications. The correlation" between high rates of maternal mortality and the number of orphaned children in a country is strong  and Malawi" estimates that there are already more than one million orphans.'
7,'100X Development is working with several key government  nonprofit  and academic partners to develop the Live" to Love program. Live to Love will provide education  nutrition and HIV screening to pregnant mothers  and then" strengthen the capacity of midwives and community healthcare workers to respond to the needs of mothers in areas" where obstetric care is systematically lacking.'
8,'Community Health. Through local collaboration with partners such as Blessings Hospital  Lumbadzi Clinic and" the Kamuzu College of Nursing  we provide health assessments and treatment to women and children in the rural" villages of Malawi. For many  this is their only access to healthcare.'
9,'In some respects  it was the partnership with Blessings Hospital that catalyzed our involvement in Malawi. We" are committed to expanding resources available through Blessings  and are currently working with them to provide" an outpatient clinic  a free “Under 5” clinic  a weekly pediatric physical therapy session  and a free ART" clinic for patients who are HIV+.'
0,'Nursing Education. In a country with only 16 obstetricians serving a population of over 16 million  it is" evident that nurses play a critical role in the healthcare system. With high rates of maternal death  and the" 10th highest infant mortality rate in the world  it is essential that the hospitals and clinics in Malawi be" staffed with fully trained medical personnel. Unfortunately  while there are more nurses than doctors  the human" resource shortage also extends to nurses  and services in rural areas are limited.'
1,'Through partnership with Kamuzu College of Nursing (Malawi) and Auburn University’s School of Nursing (US)  we are working to train and equip nursing students with the resources they need to care for the well-being of" every patient.'
2,'In 2012  we launched a collaborative training program that allowed students from both universities to work" together and implement what they learned in the classroom in clinical settings ranging from home-based care to" rural clinics. In just one week  students provided care to more than 600 women and children.'
3,'We are also working with the University of Alabama at Birmingham to facilitate the development of a" curriculum for a PhD nursing program at Kamuzu College of Nursing. This will be one of the few PhD nursing" programs available in in sub-Saharan Africa.'

5,'Lily James cannot fight the music. In the title role of 2015’s handsome Cinderella rework  her beautiful" singing served as a plot point  attracting a suitor to her like a sailor drawn in by a siren’s song. She’s" gotten another bump in visibility as the female lead of Baby Driver  another film fundamentally oriented around" music. (The swooningly romantic scene in which she and her crush Baby share a pair of earbuds at a laundromat is" already a fan-favorite.) Now she’s taken her next major role  and it’s sure to put her vocal cords through their" paces.'
6,'Here we go again  more casting news about Mamma Mia!: Here We Go Again. The Hollywood Reporter has the" exclusive that James has joined the cast already including returning talents Amanda Seyfried  Meryl Streep " Pierce Brosnan  and Colin Firth. Though she’s the official cast newbie  hers will still be a starring role; the" new film splits its time between the present-day and extended flashbacks to the early days of Donna  and James" will play the younger version of Streep’s character. And with a soundtrack featuring ABBA tracks that didn’t" make the cut for the first film as well as a handful of reprises  James should start doing her vocal warm-ups now.'
7,'That said  I cannot imagine a more terrifying task for a young performer than being told  “Make us believe" you could grow up to be Meryl Streep.” James can handle the singing and dancing no problem  but this could" present her with an unprecedented challenge as an actress. Has she seen Kramer Vs. Kramer? Who could possibly" want to be compared to that!?'
8,'During their search for a stolen vehicle Wednesday morning  Missoula Police discovered a possible forgery" case. Public Information Officer Travis Welsh explains.'
9,'“Officers received information that two people who had been determined to be suspects in a previous car" theft were presently under the Russell St. Bridge on the south side ” said Welsh. “An officer did go down and" found the two people who had been described. He was able to identify the male and female and also determined" that they were the suspects in the car theft. They were taken into custody.”'
0,'The vehicle was searched after they were taken into custody and officers dug up even more dirt on the two" suspects.'
1,'“At the recovery of the vehicle  the other officers observed evidence inside that seemed to connect or" suggest that the two were connected to a forgery scheme ” Welsh said. “Through continued investigation and" interview  probable cause was developed and currently the two are in custody being held for felony theft and" felony forgery.”'
2,'Police arrested 27-year-old Erika Jarvis and 26-year-old Chris Heaton who appeared to be in the process of forging U.S. currency. Welsh says an investigation is ongoing to discover if any counterfeit currency was actually spent in Missoula.'
